To integrate similar functionality into Shopify, you'll need to adapt the approach because Shopify doesn't support custom PHP scripts directly like WordPress does. Instead, you can use JavaScript to fetch and display data dynamically on your Shopify page. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

Create a Custom Page Template: Create a custom page template in Shopify to display the COVID-19 data.

Add JavaScript for Fetching and Displaying Data: Use JavaScript to fetch data from the API and update the HTML content on the page.

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Create a Custom Page Template
First, create a new page template in your Shopify theme. For example, you can create a new file page.covid-live-tracker.liquid in the templates directory.
add template code here . 

2. Add JavaScript for Fetching and Displaying Data
Create a new JavaScript file in your Shopify theme's assets directory named covid-tracker.js.
add js here
3. Upload the JavaScript File
Upload the covid-tracker.js file to your Shopify theme's assets directory.

4. Create/Update the Page in Shopify
Make sure your "covid live tracker" page uses the page.covid-live-tracker.liquid template. You can do this in the Shopify admin:

Go to Online Store > Pages.
Edit the "covid live tracker" page.
Select page.covid-live-tracker from the "Theme template" dropdown.
